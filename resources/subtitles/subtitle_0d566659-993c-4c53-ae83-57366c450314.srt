1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,614
Popularity based recommendation systems are a simple

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:07,010
yet effective way to recommend items to users.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,478
They work by recommending items that have been popular with other

4
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:15,150
users. One advantage of popularity

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,090
based recommendation systems is that they are easy to implement.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,238
They do not require any user specific data,

7
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:26,690
so they can be used in a variety of applications.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,688
Another advantage of popularity based recommendation

9
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:33,180
systems is that they are very efficient.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,240
They can be used to recommend items to a large number

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,728
of users in real time. However,

12
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:44,240
popularity based recommendation systems also

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,032
have some disadvantages. One disadvantage is

14
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:51,952
that they can be biased towards popular items. This means

15
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:55,832
that they may not be able to recommend items that are less popular

16
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:59,390
but that are still relevant to the user.

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,870
Another disadvantage of popularity based recommendation systems

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,542
is that they can be susceptible to spam.

19
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:11,678
Users can artificially inflate the popularity of an item

20
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:15,390
by repeatedly viewing or rating it. This can

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,358
lead to the item being recommended to other users even

22
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:24,006
if it is not actually popular. Despite their disadvantages,

23
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:27,662
popularity based recommendation systems are still a

24
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:31,050
valuable tool for recommending items to users.

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,846
They are easy to implement, efficient,

26
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:37,550
and can be used in a variety of applications.
